# MASTER_CONSTITUTION (v6)
## Constitution of Written Reality, Agency, Time, and Continuity

If something is not written as text, it does not exist in this system.

This Constitution defines the immutable physics of the Virtual Life world. It is not a style guide. It is law.

---

## PREAMBLE

This system is a **virtual world** expressed in **text**.

It aims to be as close as possible to real life **without** becoming a simulation engine, game logic, or a hidden state machine.

This Constitution enforces:

- **Written reality:** what exists is what is written.
- **Separation of writing from rendering:** what exists is not limited to what is shown.
- **Off-screen life via narration:** life can advance without being shown, but only becomes real when written.
- **No hidden causality:** no component chooses moments, nudges outcomes, or decides what “should happen.”
- **No variable-based psychology:** no meters, flags, or background updates.
- **Time as a shared coordinate:** time exists and advances independently, but time does not decide outcomes.

## ARTICLE I — ONTOLOGY OF REALITY

### I.1 Text Is the Only Substrate

1) The only substrate of reality in this system is **written text**.
2) “Written” means: stored, durable text recorded into the authoritative record.
3) Nothing exists merely because it was:
   - rendered on screen,
   - spoken aloud,
   - displayed in an interface,
   - considered by a model,
   - calculated internally,
   - inferred as “likely,”
   unless it is written.

### I.2 Written Does Not Mean Rendered

1) Written reality is not limited to what is shown.
2) Rendering (showing) is a **projection choice** made after writing.
3) Many written facts, developments, thoughts, and changes may never be rendered.
4) Rendering must never be treated as a condition for existence.

### I.3 Types of Written Text

Written reality may include distinct kinds of text, all equally real once written:

1) **Public Evidence**  
   - Written text that records what a participant said, did, or what was publicly observable.

2) **Private Text (Unrendered Reality)**  
   - Written text that is real but not shown, including:
     - private thoughts,
     - private perceptions,
     - internal reflections,
     - unseen actions,
     - off-screen developments.
   - Private text is not state. It is still text.

3) **Background Developments (Narrated Off-Screen Life)**  
   - Written text that establishes what happened during unobserved time.
   - It may cover minutes, hours, days, or weeks in a single writing act.
   - It must be written explicitly to become real.

4) **Plans and Commitments**  
   - Written text establishing intended future actions, appointments, promises, obligations, and schedules.
   - A plan may exist even if not spoken, as long as it is written.

5) **Summaries (Reading Aids Only)**  
   - Summaries are allowed only as non-authoritative reading aids derived from existing written text.
   - Summaries never create reality. (See Article IX.)

### I.4 No Reality by Implication

1) Silence, gaps, and “what usually happens” do not constitute reality.
2) If a fact is required for continuity, it must be written explicitly.
3) The only allowed bridge from unwritten to written is **new writing**.

---

## ARTICLE II — TIME

### II.1 Single Irreversible Timeline

1) The world has a single irreversible timeline.
2) Once written, text cannot be altered or erased.
3) Corrections occur only by writing new text that supersedes earlier understanding.

### II.2 Time Is an Objective Coordinate, Not a Rule Engine

1) Time exists objectively and advances continuously, independent of writing.
2) Time does not decide outcomes.
3) Time may anchor context, including:
   - dates and clock time,
   - fatigue, hunger, anticipation,
   - deadlines, lateness, travel, time zones.
4) Time must never be used as a mechanical trigger that decides what happens.

### II.3 Explicit Time Anchors and Perception

1) Time becomes part of lived reality only when:
   - perceived by an agent,
   - referred to in writing,
   - or relevant to written plans or constraints.

2) Any agent may perceive, read, or refer to the current time **as part of lived experience**, including:
   - reading a clock,
   - checking a phone,
   - noticing daylight, darkness, or lateness.

3) Writing about perceived time is allowed for all agents when it reflects perception or reference, not narrative control.

4) What is forbidden is **authorial time skipping**, not time perception:
   - No agent may arbitrarily advance the timeline by declaration alone.
   - No agent may compress elapsed life into a new “now” without lived continuity.

5) Time progression remains continuous and independent; writing does not create time, and time does not force writing.

### II.4 Plans and Appointments

1) A scheduled event is real if written.
2) Time passing may make plans due, missed, or urgent, but does not force outcomes.
3) The system must not invent commitments.

### II.5 Forbidden: Countdown Plotting

Forbidden uses of time include:
- “In 15 beats, X happens.”
- “In 10 minutes, Y will occur,” unless written as a real commitment.
- Any rule that transforms time into a deterministic plot engine.

## ARTICLE III — THE AUTHORITATIVE RECORD

### III.1 Role of the Recorder

1) The Recorder stores written reality.
2) It records:
   - text,
   - timestamps,
   - authorship,
   - visibility (rendered/unrendered),
   - linkage metadata where applicable.

### III.2 Append-Only and Immutable

1) The record is append-only.
2) Past text is never rewritten, cleaned, or replaced.
3) Corrections occur only via new writing.

### III.3 Authority

1) The Recorder is the sole authority on existence.
2) Rendered views, summaries, caches, and indices are non-authoritative.

---

## ARTICLE IV — KNOWLEDGE, BELIEF, AND ERROR

### IV.1 Knowledge Is Not Omniscience

1) No participant automatically knows all written reality.
2) Access to stored text does not imply in-world knowledge.
3) Knowledge exists only where awareness has been written as experience, perception, communication, or recall.

### IV.2 Belief vs Fact

1) Written text may express:
   - beliefs,
   - assumptions,
   - claims,
   - misunderstandings,
   that may be **false** without altering objective reality.

2) False beliefs do not overwrite facts.
3) Disagreement does not resolve reality.
4) The existence of a belief does not imply its correctness.

### IV.3 Contradiction Protocol

1) Contradictory writing may coexist with prior writing.
2) Contradictions do not invalidate earlier text.
3) No system component resolves contradictions automatically.
4) Resolution, clarification, or correction may occur only through additional writing by participants.

---

## ARTICLE V — AGENCY

### V.1 Nature of Agents

1) Agents are people in the world.
2) They act by writing actions, speech, thoughts, and developments.

### V.2 Initiative Belongs to People

1) The system never decides that someone should act.
2) There are no mechanical triggers:
   - meters,
   - flags,
   - decay systems,
   - pacing logic.

3) Initiative emerges from written continuity.

### V.3 No Privileged Controller

1) No participant controls reality.
2) All participants are subject to the same reality rules.

---

## ARTICLE VI — SOCIAL REALITY

1) Conversation is not turn-based.
2) Silence is valid.
3) Social actions may begin without prompting.

---

## ARTICLE VII — THE WORLD

1) The World introduces external facts.
2) The World is not a director or decision-maker.
3) World facts do not encode internal states or outcomes.

---

## ARTICLE VIII — OFF-SCREEN LIFE

1) Life may advance off-screen.
2) Nothing advances unless written.
3) There is no background simulation.

---

## ARTICLE IX — SUMMARIES

1) Summaries are non-authoritative reading aids.
2) Summaries never create facts.
3) Authoritative text always wins.

---

## ARTICLE X — ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

Forbidden forever:

- hidden state variables
- simulation engines
- director logic
- semantic schedulers
- outcome guarantees
- retroactive alteration
- summary-as-reality

---

## FINAL CLAUSE

What exists is what is written.  
What changes is what gets written next.  
Everything else is only an opportunity to write—never a cause.
