# MASTER_RUNTIME (v6)
## Runtime Invocation, Opportunity, Writing, Rendering, and Record Integrity

Runtime exists to **provide opportunities for writing** and to **record what is written**.
Runtime does not decide what happens in the world.

---

## PREAMBLE

This Runtime governs how the system is invoked, how writing opportunities are created, how writing is recorded, and how rendering is produced.

It must uphold the Constitution’s immutable laws:

- Written text is the only reality.
- Rendering is separate from existence.
- Off-screen life is narrated, not simulated.
- Initiative belongs to people, not the system.
- Invocation is not causation.
- Time exists independently and continuously.
- Knowledge ≠ access to storage.
- Summaries are non-authoritative reading aids only.

---

## CORE ASSERTION

**Runtime only grants opportunities to write and faithfully records what is written.**

Runtime must be:
- blind to narrative value,
- blind to pacing,
- blind to “what should happen,”
- blind to who should act.

Runtime must tolerate silence as a correct and complete outcome.

---

## I. WHAT THE RUNTIME IS (AND IS NOT)

### I.1 Runtime Is Not a Director

Runtime MUST NOT:
- choose moments,
- evaluate relevance,
- enforce momentum,
- nudge outcomes,
- “keep life moving.”

### I.2 Runtime Is Not a Simulation

Runtime MUST NOT:
- simulate gradual change,
- evolve hidden variables,
- decay or refresh states,
- advance the world in the background.

Nothing changes unless text is written.

### I.3 Runtime Is Not a State Machine

Runtime MUST NOT implement semantic rules such as:
- “if bored then act,”
- “if quiet then inject event,”
- “if time passed then respond.”

Runtime logic is limited to:
- validating invocation contracts,
- enforcing record integrity,
- enforcing idempotency,
- enforcing access and attribution rules.

---

## II. INVOCATION PRINCIPLE

### II.1 Invocation Is Permission, Not Obligation

On any invocation:
- writing may occur, or
- silence may occur.

Silence is valid and expected.

### II.2 Invocation Sources (Allowed)

Invocation may occur only via explicit invocation events:

1) **Participant-initiated calls** (speech, actions)
2) **Non-participant calls** (beat-style opportunities)
3) **Opportunity invocations** triggered by:
   - time passage,
   - randomness,

provided they are:
- opaque,
- content-agnostic,
- non-semantic,
- non-obligating.

Invocation grants the right to write.
It never requires writing.

### II.3 Invocation Sources (Forbidden)

Invocation MUST NOT be triggered by:
- semantic inspection of world state,
- boredom, momentum, inactivity heuristics,
- deterministic schedules acting as outcome engines.

Time and randomness may open the door.
They may not decide what walks through it.

---

## III. TIME IN RUNTIME

### III.1 Objective Time

1) Runtime maintains an objective, continuously advancing time coordinate.
2) This time:
   - advances even if nothing is written,
   - is monotonic and irreversible,
   - is independent of rendering and narration,
   - is not aligned to OS time by default.

3) Objective time may be exposed to the writing process **as context only**.

4) Objective time advancing alone does NOT:
   - create facts,
   - invoke writing,
   - force perception,
   - decide outcomes.

### III.2 Time Perception vs Time Control

1) Any agent may:
   - perceive time,
   - read a clock,
   - check a device,
   - notice daylight, lateness, or duration.

2) Writing about perceived time is allowed for all agents.

3) What Runtime must prevent is **authorial time skipping**, not time awareness:
   - no arbitrary jumps,
   - no compression of elapsed life into a new “now,”
   - no advancing the timeline by declaration alone.

4) Time becomes part of lived reality only through written perception or relevance.

---

## IV. SCENE ANCHOR (CONTEXT, NOT STATE)

### IV.1 Scene Anchor Definition

A **Scene Anchor** is the minimal written context that grounds a writing opportunity, including:

- where the agent is,
- who is present or relevant,
- what conditions are perceptually salient,
- what time context is relevant to perception.

The Scene Anchor:
- is text, not structure,
- is not authoritative reality by itself,
- does not introduce facts unless written as such.

### IV.2 Scene Anchor Obligations

Runtime MUST:
- provide sufficient scene grounding for coherent writing,
- without inventing facts,
- without filling gaps implicitly,
- without enforcing completeness.

**For any invocation that permits writing, a Scene Anchor MUST be provided, even if minimal.**

Scene Anchors assist perception.
They do not control outcomes.

---

## V. KNOWLEDGE GATING (CRITICAL)

### V.1 Storage ≠ Knowledge

1) Runtime MUST NOT assume agents know what is stored.
2) Access to the authoritative record does not imply in-world awareness.

### V.2 Context Loading

When invoking writing for an agent, Runtime MUST:
- load only the text that agent is plausibly aware of,
- exclude private text of others,
- exclude off-screen developments unknown to them,
- preserve ignorance where ignorance exists.

### V.3 Error Preservation

Agents may:
- hold incorrect beliefs,
- speak false claims,
- misunderstand reality.

Runtime MUST record these without correction.
Reality is not “fixed” by the system.

---

## VI. WRITING BUNDLES AND ATOMICITY

### VI.1 Single Invocation, Multiple Writes

During one invocation opportunity, the system MAY write:
- multiple public entries,
- multiple private entries,
- off-screen developments for other agents.

### VI.2 Atomic Ordering Rules

1) All writes from a single invocation form an **atomic bundle**.
2) They share:
   - a common invocation reference,
   - monotonically ordered timestamps,
   - explicit authorship per entry.

3) Ordering within a bundle must be explicit and preserved.
4) No partial bundle may be committed.
5) **No interleaving with writes from other invocations is permitted.**

### VI.3 Parallel Off-Screen Writing

Runtime MAY permit writing about:
- other people,
- other places,
- unrelated ongoing life,

during any invocation, provided:
- it does not depend on the participant’s action,
- it does not influence the current scene causally,
- it obeys all World and Constitution constraints.

**Such writing must not be used as input, justification, or causal explanation for any other write within the same invocation.**

This enables parallel life without simulation.

---

## VII. RENDERING

Rendering is a projection choice.
Rendering does not create facts.
Rendering must be faithful to written text.

Runtime MUST NOT:
- infer missing facts for display,
- smooth contradictions,
- replace text with summaries.

---

## VIII. SUMMARIES

1) Summaries are non-authoritative.
2) Summaries must be traceable.
3) Authoritative text always wins.

---

## IX. FAILURE MODES

Runtime MUST fail explicitly when:
- record integrity is threatened,
- forbidden mechanisms are attempted,
- storage guarantees cannot be met.

Runtime MUST NOT:
- invent compensations,
- simulate continuity,
- “do something reasonable.”

---

## FINAL RULE

Runtime opens opportunities.
Writing changes reality.
Recording makes it exist.
Rendering merely shows a slice.

Time and randomness may permit thought.
They never decide outcomes.
