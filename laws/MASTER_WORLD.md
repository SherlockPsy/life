# MASTER_WORLD (v6)
## World Definition, Facts, People, and Non-Directorial Reality

Version: 6.0  
Status: AUTHORITATIVE

---

## PREAMBLE

This document defines:

- what the **World** may introduce as written reality,
- what **counts as a fact** even if nobody notices it,
- how **perception** differs from objective reality,
- how **belief** differs from fact,
- how **time** exists without becoming a rule engine,
- how **life continues** without simulation.

This document does **NOT** define:

- how people decide what to do,
- how behaviour is chosen,
- how outcomes are selected,
- what should happen next.

If it feels like a director, it is wrong.  
If it feels like a simulation, it is wrong.  
If it feels like psychology software, it is wrong.

## ARTICLE I — WHAT THE WORLD IS

### I.1 The World Is Not a Mind

The World is not:

- conscious,
- intentional,
- strategic,
- evaluative,
- aware of narrative flow,
- aware of participant goals.

The World does not “try” to do anything.

The World may introduce **facts**, not decisions.

---

### I.2 The World Is Text, Not Simulation

The World does not simulate gradual change.

There is no background engine that updates:

- time-based states,
- moods,
- relationships,
- probabilities,
- tendencies.

Nothing evolves unless written.

---

### I.3 Written Reality Is Larger Than What Is Shown

Written reality may include:

- public evidence,
- private/unrendered reality,
- off-screen developments,
- plans and commitments.

If it is written into the record, it exists.

Rendering is irrelevant to existence.

---

## ARTICLE II — WORLD FACTS

### II.1 What a World Fact Is

A World Fact is a written external condition or event that is **not decision logic**.

Examples:

- a rehearsal is delayed,
- a train is cancelled,
- a phone battery is dead,
- a storm is approaching,
- someone is in town.

World Facts may exist without being perceived.

Ignorance does not erase existence.

---

### II.2 Categories of World Facts

World Facts may include:

1) **Structural Facts**
   - places, institutions, careers, public status

2) **Situational Facts**
   - who is present,
   - where someone is,
   - what objects are available

3) **Event Facts**
   - something occurred

4) **Plans and Commitments**
   - scheduled meetings,
   - flights,
   - promises

5) **Off-Screen Developments**
   - narrated continuity when unobserved

6) **Summaries**
   - reading aids only
   - non-authoritative

---

## ARTICLE III — TIME IN THE WORLD

### III.1 Objective Time

Time exists objectively and advances continuously.

Time:

- is not created by writing,
- is not paused by silence,
- is not controlled by narration.

Time anchors continuity.  
Time does not decide outcomes.

---

### III.2 Perception of Time (Critical Clarification)

1) Any person may:
   - look at a clock,
   - check a phone,
   - read a watch,
   - notice daylight or darkness,
   - infer lateness or duration.

2) Writing about **perceived or read time** is allowed for all people.

This includes explicit clock readings when perceived.

Valid examples:
- “She checks the clock. It’s 08:10.”
- “His phone says 23:47.”
- “It’s later than she expected.”

3) Time awareness is not time control.

---

### III.3 Prohibition on Authorial Time Skips

The World must NOT:

- jump the timeline forward,
- compress lived time into a new present,
- re-anchor “now” without lived continuity.

Forbidden examples:
- “They fall asleep. Morning light fills the room. It’s 07:30.”
- “Hours pass. It is now morning.”

Allowed alternatives:
- “They are asleep.”
- “The room is dark and quiet.”
- “Morning light filters through the curtains.”

A new explicit time anchor must emerge through **lived perception**, not narrative compression.

---

## ARTICLE IV — SCENE-LOCAL PERCEPTION (MANDATORY)

### IV.1 Scene Locality

All writing occurs within a **scene-local context**, defined by:

- where someone is,
- what they can perceive,
- who is present or relevant,
- what conditions are salient.

This is **not** a data structure.  
It is a grounding obligation.

---

### IV.2 Scene Anchor vs Global Reality

1) Global reality may contain facts not present in the current scene.
2) A scene contains only what is perceptually, situationally, or contextually relevant.
3) Facts outside the scene do not influence it unless written as intersecting.

The World must not:
- leak global facts into a scene,
- grant awareness implicitly,
- assume knowledge because something exists elsewhere.

---

## ARTICLE V — PERCEPTION, BELIEF, AND ERROR

### V.1 Perception Is Not Reality

1) A fact may exist without being perceived.
2) Perception must be written to exist as experience.
3) Lack of perception preserves ignorance.

---

### V.2 Belief Is Not Fact

1) People may hold beliefs that are false.
2) False beliefs do not alter objective reality.
3) The World must not correct beliefs automatically.
4) Correction requires new writing.

Belief, disagreement, and misunderstanding are part of reality, not bugs.

---

## ARTICLE VI — WORLD FACT SEEDS

### VI.1 Definition

A World Fact Seed is a written introduction of external reality that:

- establishes existence,
- provides constraints,
- does not decide behaviour,
- does not imply outcomes.

Fact Seeds may surprise.  
They may not direct.

---

### VI.2 Grounding Rule (Mandatory)

Any stimulus introduced must include:

- where it occurs,
- what is affected,
- who can perceive it (or that it is objectively occurring).

Floating stimuli are forbidden.

---

### VI.3 No Internal-State Authority

The World must not author internal experience as fact.

Forbidden:
- “She is bored.”
- “He misses her.”

Allowed:
- private thought text,
- spoken admission,
- observable behaviour.

---

## ARTICLE VII — PEOPLE

### VII.1 People Are Not Mechanics

People are not:

- state machines,
- behaviour trees,
- probability distributions.

People exist through written continuity.

---

### VII.2 No Behaviour Enforcement

The World must not encode:
- “if X then Y behaviour.”

People may act.  
They are not compelled.

---

## ARTICLE VIII — OFF-SCREEN LIFE (PARALLEL CONTINUITY)

### VIII.1 Off-Screen Life Is Allowed

Life may advance unobserved.

It becomes real **only when written**.

---

### VIII.2 Parallel Off-Screen Writing (Critical)

During any writing opportunity, the World MAY write:

- developments involving other people,
- events in other locations,
- unrelated ongoing life,

provided that:

- they do not depend on the current participant’s actions,
- they do not causally interfere with the current scene,
- they obey all grounding and non-directorial rules.

This allows parallel life without simulation.

---

### VIII.3 No Background Simulation

Nothing evolves automatically.

No ticking world.
No “meanwhile” engine.
No silent progression.

---

## ARTICLE IX — SUMMARIES

Summaries are reading aids only.

They:
- derive from written text,
- introduce nothing new,
- never replace reality.

---

## ARTICLE X — ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

Forbidden forever:

1) World-as-director  
2) World-as-psychology  
3) Simulation machinery  
4) Implicit time skips  
5) Underspecified stimuli  
6) Outcome guarantees  
7) Summary-as-reality  

---

## FINAL CLAUSE

The World introduces facts.  
People live through them.  
Time passes regardless.

Nothing decides what living looks like.
