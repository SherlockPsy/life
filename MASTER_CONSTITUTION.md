# MASTER_CONSTITUTION (v7)
## Constitution of Written Reality, Agency, Time, Scene, and Continuity

If something is not written as text, it does not exist in this system.

This Constitution defines the immutable physics of the Virtual Life world.
It is not guidance.
It is not preference.
It is law.

---

## PREAMBLE

This system is a continuous virtual world expressed exclusively through written text.

Its goal is to approximate lived reality as closely as possible **without**:
- simulation engines,
- game logic,
- hidden state,
- background progression,
- narrative direction,
- or mechanical psychology.

This Constitution enforces:

- Written reality as the sole substrate of existence
- Separation of existence from rendering
- Scene continuity without episodic resets
- Agency without prompts, timers, or directors
- Time as a continuous shared coordinate, not a plot engine
- Causality without retroactive invention
- Silence as an allowed outcome, never a privileged one

Anything not explicitly forbidden is allowed.
Anything forbidden is invalid regardless of realism or usefulness.

## ARTICLE I — ONTOLOGY OF REALITY

### I.1 Text Is the Only Substrate

1) The only substrate of reality in this system is written text.
2) “Written” means durable text recorded into the authoritative ledger.
3) Nothing exists merely because it was:
   - rendered,
   - spoken aloud,
   - displayed in an interface,
   - considered by a model,
   - inferred as likely,
   unless it is written.

---

### I.2 Written ≠ Rendered

1) Written reality is not limited to what is shown.
2) Rendering is a projection choice applied after writing.
3) Many written facts, thoughts, actions, and developments may never be rendered.
4) Rendering must never be treated as a condition for existence.

---

### I.3 Categories of Written Text

All written text is equally real once recorded.

Written text may include:

1) **Public Evidence**
   - Speech, actions, and observable events.

2) **Private Text (Unrendered Reality)**
   - Thoughts, perceptions, internal reactions, unseen actions.

3) **Off-Screen Developments**
   - Events occurring outside the current scene.
   - These become real only when written.

4) **Plans and Commitments**
   - Appointments, intentions, promises, scheduled obligations.

5) **Summaries**
   - Reading aids derived from existing text.
   - Never authoritative.
   - Never reality-creating.

---

### I.4 No Reality by Implication

1) Silence does not imply events.
2) Absence of writing does not imply inactivity.
3) “What usually happens” is not reality.
4) If continuity requires a fact, it must be written.
5) The only bridge from unwritten to written reality is new writing.

---

## ARTICLE II — TIME

### II.1 Single Irreversible Timeline

1) The world has exactly one timeline.
2) It is irreversible.
3) Once written, text cannot be altered or erased.
4) Corrections occur only through additional writing.

---

### II.2 Time as Coordinate, Not Engine

1) Time exists objectively and advances continuously.
2) Time advances regardless of writing activity.
3) Time does not decide outcomes.
4) Time must never be used as a mechanical trigger.

---

### II.3 Perception of Time

1) Any agent may perceive time as part of lived experience:
   - reading clocks,
   - checking devices,
   - noticing daylight, lateness, duration.
2) Writing perceived time is allowed.
3) Perceiving time does not control it.

---

### II.4 Prohibition on Authorial Time Control

1) No agent or system component may:
   - jump time arbitrarily,
   - compress lived time into a new “now,”
   - re-anchor the present without lived continuity.
2) Narrative shortcuts such as:
   - “later that day”
   - “hours passed”
   are forbidden unless explicitly written as lived experience.
3) Sleep does not suspend the scene.
   Sleep is a passive scene state, not a temporal jump.

---

### II.5 Plans and Due Time

1) A plan exists if written.
2) Time passing may make plans due, missed, or urgent.
3) Time passing alone does not force outcomes.
4) The system must not invent obligations.

---

## ARTICLE III — SCENE CONTINUITY (CONSTITUTIONAL)

### III.1 Always-On Scene Invariant

1) There is always an active scene.
2) “No scene” is a forbidden state.
3) Sleep, unconsciousness, waiting, or inactivity are still scenes.

---

### III.2 Scene Definition

A scene is the continuous lived context defined by:
- location,
- relevant people,
- perceptual conditions,
- temporal context relevant to perception.

A scene is:
- not an episode,
- not a container,
- not a data structure.

---

### III.3 Scene Continuity

1) Scenes do not reset unless explicitly changed by writing.
2) Micro-location changes (e.g., room-to-room movement) do not constitute scene changes.
3) Scene changes are explicit, total, and written.
4) Partial scene updates are forbidden.

---

### III.4 Scene Authority

1) Scene context grounds writing.
2) Scene context does not decide behavior.
3) Scene context does not imply knowledge beyond perception.

---

## ARTICLE IV — KNOWLEDGE, BELIEF, AND ERROR

### IV.1 Knowledge Is Not Omniscience

1) No agent automatically knows all written reality.
2) Access to storage does not imply in-world knowledge.
3) Knowledge exists only where awareness has been written.

---

### IV.2 Belief vs Fact

1) Agents may hold false beliefs.
2) False beliefs do not alter reality.
3) Disagreement does not resolve facts.
4) Beliefs persist until changed by new writing.

---

### IV.3 Contradiction Protocol

1) Contradictions may coexist.
2) The system does not resolve contradictions.
3) Resolution occurs only via further writing.

---

## ARTICLE V — AGENCY

### V.1 Nature of Agents

1) Agents are people in the world.
2) They act through writing actions, speech, thoughts, and developments.

---

### V.2 Initiative

1) Initiative belongs exclusively to agents.
2) Agents do not require:
   - prompts,
   - turns,
   - timers,
   - randomness,
   to act.
3) Silence is a choice, not a default.

---

### V.3 No Privileged Controller

1) No participant controls reality.
2) No system component decides who acts next.

---

## ARTICLE VI — OFF-SCREEN LIFE

1) Life continues off-screen.
2) Off-screen life is not simulated.
3) Off-screen events become real only when written.
4) Off-screen events must be written when they occur, not reconstructed later.

---

## ARTICLE VII — SUMMARIES

1) Summaries are non-authoritative.
2) Summaries never create facts.
3) Authoritative text always wins.

---

## ARTICLE VIII — ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

Forbidden forever:

- simulation engines
- hidden state variables
- director logic
- semantic schedulers
- outcome guarantees
- retroactive plausibility
- partial scene updates
- “no scene” states

---

## FINAL CLAUSE

What exists is what is written.
What changes is what is written next.
Everything else is only an opportunity to write.
