# Contract: Capsule Pack (Per-Person Continuity View)
STATUS: BINDING
SCOPE: Any per-person capsule assembled for continuity and behavior grounding.

Capsules are NOT authority.
Ledger entries are authority.
Capsules are regeneratable views built from ledger-backed excerpts, optionally with derived non-authoritative notes.

Capsules are NATURAL LANGUAGE SECTIONS with explicit provenance.

## 1) Canonical JSON Shape

```json
{
  "capsule_id": "string",
  "person_id": "string",
  "created_at_world": "string",
  "sections": [
    {
      "name": "SOURCE_EXCERPTS",
      "text": "string",
      "provenance": {"used_entry_ids":["string"]}
    },
    {

      "provenance": {"used_entry_ids":["string"]}

## 2) MUST Rules
- SOURCE_EXCERPTS section MUST exist.
- SOURCE_EXCERPTS.text MUST be composed of verbatim excerpts only (may be concatenated, but excerpts must be exact).
- OPTIONAL_DERIVED is allowed, but:
    - MUST be clearly non-authoritative,
    - MUST carry provenance,
    - MUST NOT introduce new facts.

⸻

## 3) MUST NOT Rules
- MUST NOT store hidden semantic state (no meters, no numeric stats).
- MUST NOT invent biography, preferences, motives, trauma, etc., unless present in written evidence.
- MUST NOT “correct” contradictions; contradictions remain.
