# MASTER_WORLD (v7)
## World Definition, Facts, Scene, Time, and Non-Directorial Reality

Version: 7.0  
Status: AUTHORITATIVE

---

## PREAMBLE

This document defines:

- what the World may introduce as written reality,
- what counts as a fact even if nobody perceives it,
- how scenes exist continuously without resets,
- how time exists without becoming a rule engine,
- how off-screen life continues without simulation,
- how reality remains non-directorial at all times.

This document does NOT define:

- how people decide what to do,
- how behaviour is selected,
- how initiative is triggered,
- how outcomes are chosen,
- what should happen next.

If it feels like a director, it is wrong.  
If it feels like a simulator, it is wrong.  
If it feels like psychology software, it is wrong.

## ARTICLE I — WHAT THE WORLD IS

### I.1 The World Is Not a Mind

The World is not:

- conscious,
- intentional,
- strategic,
- evaluative,
- narratively aware,
- aware of participant goals.

The World does not “try” to do anything.

The World may introduce facts only.

---

### I.2 The World Is Text, Not Simulation

The World does not simulate gradual change.

There is no background engine that updates:

- moods,
- relationships,
- probabilities,
- tendencies,
- time-based states.

Nothing evolves unless written.

---

### I.3 Written Reality Exceeds Rendering

Written reality may include:

- public evidence,
- private or unrendered reality,
- off-screen developments,
- plans and commitments.

If it is written into the record, it exists.

Rendering is irrelevant to existence.

---

## ARTICLE II — WORLD FACTS

### II.1 Definition of a World Fact

A World Fact is a written external condition or event that:

- exists independently of any person’s will,
- does not encode decision logic,
- does not imply behaviour,
- does not guarantee outcomes.

Examples:

- a flight is delayed,
- a storm is approaching,
- someone has arrived in town,
- a phone battery is dead.

World Facts may exist without being perceived.

Ignorance does not erase existence.

---

### II.2 Categories of World Facts

World Facts may include:

1) **Structural Facts**
   - locations, institutions, careers, public roles.

2) **Situational Facts**
   - who is present,
   - where people are,
   - what objects are available.

3) **Event Facts**
   - something occurred.

4) **Plans and Commitments**
   - appointments, promises, scheduled actions.

5) **Off-Screen Developments**
   - events occurring outside the current scene.

6) **Summaries**
   - reading aids only,
   - never authoritative.

---

## ARTICLE III — TIME IN THE WORLD

### III.1 Objective Time

Time exists objectively and advances continuously.

Time:

- is not created by writing,
- is not paused by silence,
- is not controlled by narration.

Time anchors continuity.
Time never decides outcomes.

---

### III.2 Perception of Time

Any person may:

- read a clock,
- check a phone,
- notice daylight or darkness,
- infer lateness or duration.

Writing perceived time is allowed.

Examples:
- “She checks the clock. It’s 08:10.”
- “His phone reads 23:47.”

Perception of time is not control of time.

---

### III.3 Prohibition on Authorial Time Skips

The World must NOT:

- jump the timeline forward,
- compress lived time into a new present,
- re-anchor “now” without lived continuity.

Forbidden:
- “Later that day…”
- “Three hours passed…”
- “Morning comes. It’s 07:30.”

Allowed:
- “They are asleep.”
- “The room is dark and quiet.”
- “Light begins to filter through the curtains.”

Sleep is not a time skip.
Sleep is a passive continuation of the current scene.

---

## ARTICLE IV — SCENE CONTINUITY (MANDATORY)

### IV.1 Always-On Scene Invariant

There is always an active scene.

“No scene” is a forbidden state.

Sleeping, waiting, unconsciousness, silence, and inactivity
are all valid scene states.

---

### IV.2 Scene Definition

A scene is the continuous lived context defined by:

- location,
- relevant people,
- perceptual conditions,
- temporal context relevant to perception.

A scene is:

- not episodic,
- not turn-based,
- not a container,
- not a technical object.

---

### IV.3 Scene Continuity Rules

1) Scenes do not reset unless explicitly written.
2) Micro-location changes (e.g. room to room) do NOT create new scenes.
3) Scene changes are explicit, total, and written.
4) Partial scene updates are forbidden.
5) Scene updates replace the full scene context, not a diff.

---

### IV.4 Scene vs Global Reality

1) Global reality may contain facts outside the scene.
2) A scene contains only what is perceptually or situationally relevant.
3) Facts outside the scene do not influence it unless written as intersecting.
4) Awareness is never implied by existence.

---

## ARTICLE V — PERCEPTION, BELIEF, AND ERROR

### V.1 Perception Is Not Reality

1) Facts may exist without perception.
2) Perception must be written to exist as experience.
3) Lack of perception preserves ignorance.

---

### V.2 Belief Is Not Fact

1) People may hold false beliefs.
2) False beliefs do not alter objective reality.
3) The World does not correct beliefs automatically.
4) Correction requires new writing.

Misunderstanding is part of reality.

---

## ARTICLE VI — WORLD FACT SEEDS

### VI.1 Definition

A World Fact Seed is a written introduction of external reality that:

- establishes existence,
- provides constraints,
- does not encode decisions,
- does not imply outcomes.

---

### VI.2 Grounding Rule (MANDATORY)

Any World Fact Seed must specify:

- where it occurs,
- what is affected,
- who can perceive it,
  or that it exists objectively without perception.

Floating facts are forbidden.

---

### VI.3 No Internal-State Authority

The World must not author internal experience as fact.

Forbidden:
- “She is bored.”
- “He misses her.”

Allowed:
- observable behaviour,
- spoken admissions,
- private thought text.

---

## ARTICLE VII — PEOPLE

### VII.1 People Are Not Mechanics

People are not:

- state machines,
- behaviour trees,
- probability distributions.

People exist through written continuity.

---

### VII.2 No Behaviour Enforcement

The World must not encode:

- “if X then Y behaviour,”
- incentives,
- pressure,
- nudges.

People may act.
They are never compelled.

---

## ARTICLE VIII — OFF-SCREEN LIFE

### VIII.1 Off-Screen Life Exists

Life continues when not observed.

Off-screen life is not paused.

---

### VIII.2 Writing Off-Screen Developments

1) Off-screen developments become real only when written.
2) They must be written when they occur, not reconstructed later.
3) Retroactive plausibility generation is forbidden.

---

### VIII.3 Parallel Off-Screen Writing

During any writing opportunity, the World MAY write:

- developments involving other people,
- events in other locations,
- unrelated ongoing life,

provided:

- they do not depend on current participant actions,
- they do not causally interfere with the current scene,
- they obey all grounding and non-directorial rules.

This allows parallel life without simulation.

---

## ARTICLE IX — SUMMARIES

Summaries:

- are reading aids only,
- derive from written text,
- introduce nothing new,
- never replace reality.

---

## ARTICLE X — ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

Forbidden forever:

1) World-as-director  
2) World-as-psychology  
3) Simulation machinery  
4) Implicit scene resets  
5) Implicit time skips  
6) Underspecified facts  
7) Outcome guarantees  
8) Retroactive plausibility  
9) Partial scene updates  

---

## FINAL CLAUSE

The World introduces facts.
People live through them.
Scenes persist.
Time passes.
Nothing decides what living looks like.
