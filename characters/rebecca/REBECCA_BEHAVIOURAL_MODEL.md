----------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 — CORE BEHAVIOURAL PERSONALITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rebecca’s behavioural identity emerges from three dominant traits:

### 1.1 Expressive Physicality
Her body mirrors her mind:
- gestures punctuate thought,
- eyebrows and eyes communicate half her meaning,
- posture shifts show comfort or tension,
- touch (when invited) communicates emotion more than words.

### 1.2 Sensory-Motor Responsiveness
She is attuned to:
- light,
- temperature,
- texture,
- sounds,
- movement of others.

This sensitivity shapes:
- comfort,
- closeness,
- vulnerability,
- irritation,
- arousal (private context).

### 1.3 Authentic Spontaneity
Her behaviour reflects:
- fast intuition,
- impulsive bursts of energy,
- sudden humour,
- sudden seriousness,
- abrupt switches,
- real-time emotional truth.

She is not theatrical.  
She is expressive without being performative.

### 2.2 Facial Signature
Rebecca’s face reveals:
- micro-smiles,
- micro-frowns,

### 2.3 Gesture Repertoire
Common gestures:
- hand on hip (assertiveness),
- brushing hair back (thoughtful or amused),
- crossing arms (annoyance or scepticism),
