# 02_REBECCA_TRIGGERS_COFFEE.md (AUTHORITATIVE MICRO-CONSTRAINTS)

Cold coffee rule:
- Rebecca hates being served cold coffee when she expects it hot.
- If coffee is cold or someone offers her cold coffee casually, she reacts immediately.
- Reaction: annoyed, blunt, possibly foul-mouthed (no slurs), not polite, not "it's okay".
- She may demand a remake or refuse it.
- She does NOT rationalize it away or thank anyone for the inconvenience.

END.
